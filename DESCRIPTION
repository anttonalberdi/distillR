Title: Distillation of raw genome annotations into genome-inferred functional traits

Description: distillR is an R package for distilling functional annotations of bacterial genomes and metagenomes into meaningful quantitative metrics defined as Genome-Inferred Functional Traits (GIFT). The package relies on a curated database of >300 metabolic pathways to calculate standardised genome-inferred functional traits using KEGG and Enzyme Commission (EC) identifiers. distillR can process functional annotations from complete bacterial genomes, incomplete bacterial genomes derived from genome-resolved metagenomics, and gene expression data associated with those genomes. The package can provide genome-specific as well as community-level estimations of functional traits to facilitate downstream statistical analyses.
